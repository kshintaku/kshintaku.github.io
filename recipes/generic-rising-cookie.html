                <p>This recipe makes quite a lot of cookies, ie 30+. Units are easily halved so make at your preference.
                    I use these because it keeps units simple and I don't have leftover chocolate chips or other
                    ingredients.</p>

                    <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
                            <li>2 large eggs</li>
                            <li>2/3 cup white sugar</li>
                            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
                            <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 cup (372g) all-purpose flour</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon smoked salt flakes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Directions:</h3>
                <h4>Preheat oven to 350F</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>With the ingredient gathered, start by mixing softened butter. An easy way to do this is by
                        microwaving butter in 5 second increments until softened. Usually only takes 2-3 times.</li>
                    <li>Mix butter and sugars together until well mixed and smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add egg and vanilla extract and mix until well combined.</li>
                    <li>In a seperate bowl, combine all dry ingredients. I advise to sift the flour and powders to make
                        mixing easier. Don't try to force salt through a sifter, you want the large flakes in you
                        cookies.</li>
                    <li>Slowly integrate dry ingredients with wet ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Optional* - Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours to overnight.</li>
                    <li>Scoop cookies into 2 tablespoon servings and place on tray at least 2 inches apart from each
                        other</li>
                    <li>Bake at 350F for 15 minutes, rotating tray halfway through.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Explaination:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Butter needs to be soft, but not excessively soft. The softer the butter, the denser the cookie
                        will come out. For example, if you use melted butter, the cookie will be crispy and flat. If the
                        butter is cold it will not mix and you'll spend a lot of time trying to combine everything. Just
                        microwave the butter from the fridge for less than 15 seconds and you should be good. Any butter
                        will do fine, Lucerne or Kerrygold or Costco, as long as it's unsalted it should be fine.</li>
                    <li>Egg, the whole egg lets your cookie be fluffy, if you don't want the cookie to rise or want it
                        crispy, use only egg yolk.</li>
                    <li>White sugar, use normal granulated. You can try baker's sugar, or more finely ground white
                        sugar, but then you should use less. The finer sugar will mix easier but it's also denser so you
                        should measure based on weight and not volume. Don't use powdered sugar, that contains extra
                        starch and can make your cookies very hard.</li>
                    <li>Brown sugar, I used to use dark brown sugar, but found light brown to be better at bringing out
                        the natural flavors of ingredients I add such as cocoa or matcha. You can use either, but dark
                        brown sugar will result in a darker looking cookie.</li>
                    <li>I've only ever used vanilla extract, I've heard you can substitute 1:1 for vanilla paste but
                        haven't tried yet, do whatever is easier for you or which you prefer, I'll update when I get
                        more information.</li>
                    <li>All purpose flour, I mostly use King Arthur flour, but use Gold Medal a lot too, I don't believe
                        it makes much of a difference to the end result in any significant way.</li>
                    <li>Baking soda is baking soda, I haven't noticed any difference in brands but try to use something
                        fresh, ie less than a year old since I know everyone likes to get one and keep it forever.</li>
                    <li>Salt, this one can make a difference if you splurge. I suggest using salt flakes, they give a
                        better flavor to the final product due to the salt's shape. Iodized or whatever doesn't matter
                        as much. Sea salt is slightly better than regular table salt, but flakes are the way to go from
                        my experience. I've recently experimented with smoked salt, and although quite expensive, it
                        will last a long time and has great results. Adjust based on your taste and preference,
                        measurements vary depending on type, so try different amounts depending on type. IE, iodized
                        salt is denser than sea salt, so you should use more sea salt to get the same savory effect.
